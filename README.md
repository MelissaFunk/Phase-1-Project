Start My Day is an app that helps users begin the day by organizing their to do list and providing affirmations based on how the user feels.

MVP:
- Users can input tasks to display them in a list (‘submit’ event listener)
- User can delete tasks individually (‘click’ event listener)
- Users can use a refresh button to delete all tasks (‘click’ event listener)
- Users can select how they are feeling from a drop-down menu, and an image & affirmation will render on the page depending on their selection (from db.json created file) (‘change’’ event listener)
- Keep items on page when refreshing the page

Stretch Goals:
- Have a refresh button that deletes all the task items
- Tasks are organized into groups (eat breakfast, eat lunch, eat dinner => Food)
- Randomize a larger db.json database
